The work of the Compensation Fund comes in the wake of the improved controls and systems that the Unemployment Insurance Fund has instituted resulting in better vetting of claims and claimants. As of today, the UIF has assessed and paid over R43 billion (R43 532 125 278.30) in 9 934 007 payments to employees from 874 852 employer applications. A total number of over one million employers have submitted claims on behalf of 11 283 665 employees. However, there are still 443 369 employees who have not been declared by employers and until that is the case, the claims will remain in abeyance. “We still have about 443 369 undeclared employees whose April, May and June claims we could not process for payments, and we urge employers to make declarations either electronically on uFiling or by completing the UI-19 form to Covid19declarations@labour.gov.za in a case of less than 10 employees,” said the acting UIF Commissioner Marsha Bronkhorst. Bronkhorst said the new controls that have been instituted in the wake of the Auditor-General’s report have not only made the process smoother but have also weeded out undeserving claims, including those made on behalf of deceased persons, prisoners and other unqualifying claimants. – SAnews.gov.za
