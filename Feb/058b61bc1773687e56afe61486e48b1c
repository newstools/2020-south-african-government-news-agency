By Onalenna Mhlongo Eskom says there is no load shedding expected today, but the possibility of load shedding during the week remains. “We remind customers that the system remains vulnerable and that load shedding can be implemented at short notice if there are any additional changes in the system performance,” Eskom said on Tuesday. Even though there are some improvements, Eskom has requested customers to reduce demand and to use electricity sparingly during this period. “There is a possibility of increased load shedding over the next 18 months as we are conducting critical maintenance to restore the ageing plant to good health,” Eskom announced. Customers can help reduce demand by doing the following. Customers may check load shedding schedules on (https://loadshedding.eskom.co.za) or local municipal websites, depending on their electricity supplier, to review amendments.
