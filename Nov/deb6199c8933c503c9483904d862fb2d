Vaccine According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), more cases of COVID-19 have been reported in the past four weeks than in the first six months of the pandemic. “Across Europe and North America, hospitals and ICU units are filling up or full,” said WHO Director-General, Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus. Speaking during a media briefing on Friday, 20 November, Ghebreyesus welcomed the good news from vaccine trials, which he said gives hope towards ending the pandemic. According to reports, Pfizer and its partner, BioNTech, are filing for emergency authorisation in the United States of their COVID-19 vaccine. Primary efficacy analysis demonstrates the vaccine to be 95% effective against COVID-19, starting 28 days after the first dose, while the trial showed the vaccine protects 94% of adults over the age of 65. Ghebreyesus has urged people to continue to use the precautionary tools to "interrupt" the chains of transmission and save lives. WHO has reported 57 882 183 confirmed global cases of COVID-19, including 1 377 395 deaths, to date. – SAnews.gov.za
