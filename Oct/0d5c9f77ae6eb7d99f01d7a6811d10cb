Minister of Public Enterprises, Pravin Gordhan, has welcomed government’s commitment to provide R10.5 billion to finalise the Business Rescue Plan (BRP) and restructuring of South African Airways (SAA). Minister of Finance, Tito Mboweni, made the commitment, when he presented the Medium Term Budget Policy Statement (MTBPS) in Parliament on Wednesday. “Failure to allocate the funds would have resulted in the liquidation of the airline at the cost of more than R18.5 billion.
