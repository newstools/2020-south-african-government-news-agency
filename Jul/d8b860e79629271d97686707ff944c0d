SARS Commissioner Edward Kieswetter lauded officials for Tuesday’s finds. “Criminal and illicit economic activities are rife and result in billions of Rands of losses in tax and customs revenue to the fiscus. In addition, it does seriously harm to our domestic economy. I am therefore very pleased with the success at ORTIA by our customs officials. “I wish to express sincere appreciation to our customs officers for this diligence in fighting these unacceptable criminal activities,” he said. Kieswetter issued a stern warning to those who are engaged in criminal syndicate work. “We will spare no effort in confronting and dealing with any criminal acts that threatens the well-being of our country and depriving our future generation from witnessing the beauty of nature as represented by our rhinoceros. We will not rest until all are caught,” he said. – SAnews.gov.za
