Eskom has announced that no load shedding is expected today. However, the power generation system remains constrained and vulnerable. “During the peak hours, we are utilising emergency generation reserves to supplement supply. The possibility that load shedding may be implemented at short notice remains high, should the system performance deteriorate,” Eskom said. As of Monday afternoon, unplanned breakdowns or outages were at 11 337MW and planned maintenance outages are at 4 966MW. “It is only through partnership between Eskom and all stakeholders that we may soon emerge from these difficult times. “We urge every South African to cooperate in managing electricity consumption with care to help us minimise load shedding. We thank you for your cooperation and understanding so far,” Eskom said. Customers have been requested to continue to use electricity sparingly to assist Eskom to reduce demand, by using the following tips: - Keep morning showers short to lessen the load during morning peak. - Take food out of the freezer for dinner and put it in the fridge to thaw. It’ll save having to use the microwave to defrost it later. - Set air conditioners’ average temperature at 23°C. - Switch off geysers over peak periods. - Unplug cell phone chargers before leaving the house. - Use the cold water tap rather than using the geyser every time. - Set the swimming pool pump cycle to run twice a day, three hours at a time. - At the end of the day, turn off computers, copiers, printers and fax machines at the switch. Customers can get their load shedding schedules on the Eskom website at https://loadshedding.eskom.co.za or local municipal websites, depending on their electricity supplier, to review amendments. - SAnews.gov.za
