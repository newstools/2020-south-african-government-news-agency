Meanwhile, the country’s recovery rate is sitting at 76% after 437 617 people recovered from COVID-19. The figures are based on a total 3 315 497 tests, 20 063 of which were done since the last report. The World Health Organisation (WHO) said there are now 20 439 814 cases and 744 385 deaths globally. According to WHO, the outbreak in the African region has continued to slow down. A total of 75 326 new confirmed COVID-19 cases, which  translates to a 9% increase, were reported in 44 countries between 5 and 11 August, compared to the 13% jump recorded during the previous reporting period between 29 July and 5 August, WHO said this week. “While South Africa reported the majority of new cases ( 44 791 or 60%), it also recorded a remarkable downward trajectory in trend. "There were also reductions in incidence cases in Nigeria, Ghana and Algeria in the past week. While these indicators are encouraging, the figures should be cautiously interpreted, as they may be affected by many factors, including the current testing capacity and strategy,” WHO said. – SAnews.gov.za
