Struggling consumers NCR Chief Executive Officer Nomsa Motshegare advised consumers battling to keep up with their payments to contact their credit providers first to negotiate for lower instalments or some kind of relief to assist them with their debts. If this fails, consumers are further advised to approach registered debt counsellors for assistance. Motshegare further advised that consumers who have credit life insurance should make a claim against their credit life insurance. Credit life insurance is an insurance that a consumer purchases when applying for credit or loan. It covers the outstanding debt in the event of unforeseen circumstances such as death, retrenchment, unemployment, inability to earn an income, disability and others. In the event of the consumer becoming unemployed or unable to earn an income, the credit life insurance cover provides that credit providers must settle / pay the consumer’s debt for a period of 12 months or for the remaining repayment period or until the consumer finds employment or is able to earn an income, whichever period is shorter.

The NCR was established as the regulator under the National Credit Act 34 of 2005 (NCA) and is responsible for the regulation of the South African credit industry.
