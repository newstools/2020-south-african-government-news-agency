Transport Minister Fikile Mbalula has assured the Standing Committee on Public Accounts (Scopa) that the challenges faced by the Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa will be addressed. “Following my last Scopa appearance and from what transpired, we elected to dissolve the Interim Board and place Prasa [Passenger Rail Agency of South Africa] under administration. This was not an easy decision to make but was necessitated by the urgent need to tackle these challenges and get our trains back on track,” the Minister said. The Minister, together with Prasa officials, appeared before Scopa in Parliament, on Wednesday. Mbalula last briefed the Scopa of developments at Prasa in November 2019. The agency’s interim board was dissolved in December last year and the entity was placed under administration. Administrator Bongisizwe Mpondo was appointed for a period of 12 months, after which a permanent board will be appointed to run the affairs of Prasa. Mpondo has appointed a Panel of Technical Advisors to assist in turning the company’s fortunes around.
