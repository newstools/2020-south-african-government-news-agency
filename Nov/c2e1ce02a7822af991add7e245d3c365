The G20 is the forum for international economic cooperation, which brings together the leaders of both developed and developing countries from every continent. The Kingdom of Saudi Arabia’s King Salman bin Abdulaziz Al Saud said he was looking forward to welcoming all the delegates. “It is my pleasure to welcome you as the kingdom assumes the 2020 G20 Presidency and announce to the world our pursuit to create a cooperative environment for the G20 to introduce policies and initiatives that will fulfil the hopes of the people of the world.” – SAnews.gov.za
