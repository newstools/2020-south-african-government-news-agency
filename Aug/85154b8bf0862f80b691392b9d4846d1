Mkhize salutes doctors Engaging doctors and health professionals on Monday, the Minister thanked them for the role they are playing in the face of the deadly pandemic. “Today is about you, the frontline healthcare workers. The ones in the trenches who hold the human face and render the human touch to all the policies, regulations, science and academic research that has flooded the health service delivery space, as we were confronted with a virus for which we had no precedent and no formula. “It is the doctor that must examine, test, probe, reassess, worry and dedicate his abilities towards the management of life." The Minister said he appreciated the uncertainly under which the doctors are working and the frustrations they face. “The fear of knowing every time that the next patient could be the one that infects you and not knowing how your own body will respond to the virus.” Mkhize saluted them for the sheer tenacity and resilience they have portrayed, which has positioned leaders in the global COVID-19 response. “This battle has not been without its casualties. Over 27 000 of our colleagues have become infected with the virus and tragically it has robbed us of 240 of our talented healthcare workers. We mourn every soul lost to this enemy.” The Minister assured the healthcare workers that government will continue to engage with structures representing them, as they seek to create a new culture of mutual understanding and respect. Meanwhile, Mkhize said this is no time to be complacent, as the number of infections drop. “We have now started to dismantle some of the field hospitals, as we have concluded field hospital beds are no longer necessary. Now, we shift our focus to facility refurbishment and oxygen reticulation,” he said. However, discussions to foster co-operation between private and public sectors are ongoing. “This discussion needs to continue, as we have learnt through this pandemic that we are all health service providers and the future will be much better for all South Africans if we continue to operate as a united front,” Mkhize said. He hopes the crisis will advance the cause of Universal Health Coverage through the National Health Insurance. – SAnews.gov.za
