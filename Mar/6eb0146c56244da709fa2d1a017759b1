The Department of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development has reiterated that the entire food value chain is an essential service that will keep operating during the national lockdown. “The agriculture and food supply sector remains a vital cog during this period. “In terms of the Amended Regulation No. 398 of the Disaster Management Act, 2002, the sector is responsible for food security and has been declared as essential. This includes the harvesting and storage of agricultural commodities. “This Regulation re-emphasises that the entire food value chain -- from farm-related operations, agro-processing and food manufacturing, logistics and related services, wholesale and retail services, and all support functions that ensure efficient delivery of the agro-food system -- has to be functional to ensure that there is access to sufficient, safe and nutritious food,” the department said in a statement. The Minister of Agriculture, Land Reform and Rural Development, Thoko Didiza, has once again stressed that there is no need for the panic buying of food. “This type of buying only serves to create distortions and artificial scarcities within the food supply sector,” said the Minister. The intervention measures that government and the agricultural food value chain have put in place include: “The safety of our farmers and farmworkers on and off work is very important to us,” said the department.
