As the country’s dam levels continue to drop week-on-week, the Department of Water and Sanitation, through its National Command Centre (NCC) is distributing health and hygiene materials for residents to substitute water use, as a means to curb the spread of COVID-19. Water and Sanitation spokesperson Sputnik Ratau said the department has in the previous week delivered close to 5 000 hand sanitisers, including 1 100 face masks and 2 300 germ protection bar soaps to various municipalities for further distribution to members of the community. “We acknowledge that the spread of COVID-19 has increased water use in many households. The distribution of hygiene material is our way of assisting those in need and to increase efforts to use water prudently,” Ratau said.
