Eskom says it does not expect to implement rotational load shedding on Tuesday. It warned, however, that there is a possibility that South Africans will experience it because there is a high number of unplanned breakdowns. “We are currently utilising emergency generation reserves to supplement supply. The generation system remains constrained, vulnerable and unpredictable. Load shedding could be implemented at short notice if there is any negative change in the generation system performance,” Eskom said in a statement. Unplanned breakdowns or outages were at 12 255MW as at 7:25am this morning and planned maintenance outages are at 3 673MW. Eskom reminded South Africans that there is a possibility of increased load shedding over the next 18 months as the utility conducts critical maintenance to restore the ageing plant to good health. Eskom requests customers to continue to use electricity sparingly and to assist us in reducing demand by doing the following: • Set air-conditioners’ average temperature at 23ºC •Switch off geysers over peak periods •Use the cold water tap rather than using the geyser every time •Set the swimming pool pump cycle to run twice a day, three hours at a time •At the end of the day, turn off computers, copiers, printers and fax machines at the switch. Eskom appealed to customers to revisit their load shedding schedules at http://loadshedding.eskom.co.za or their local municipal websites, depending on their electricity supplier, to review amendments. – SAnews.gov.za
