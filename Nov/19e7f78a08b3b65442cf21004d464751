The Eastern Cape has 3 784 active cases, the Northern Cape 3 597, the North West 3 399, Mpumalanga 576 and Limpopo 527. “Our recoveries now stand at 657 500, which translates to a recovery rate of 90%,” Mkhize said in his statement. The information is based on the 4 852 918 tests conducted, 10 402 of which were performed since the last report. According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), globally, there are 46 403 652 confirmed cases of COVID-19, including 1 198 569 deaths to date. COVID-19 cases peak globally WHO Director-General (DG), Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, is currently self-isolating after coming into contact with someone who has tested positive for COVID-19. “I am well and without symptoms but will self-quarantine in the coming days, in line with WHO protocols. “At this time, it is critically important that we all comply with health guidance,” Ghebreyesus said at a virtual briefing, adding that this is how the chain of transmission can be broken. While many countries have brought COVID-19 under control, cases in some countries in Europe and North America continue to spike. “This is another critical moment for action, another critical moment for leaders to step up,” Ghebreyesus stressed. The DG believes that everyone has a role to play in suppressing transmission. He said the WHO has released videos featuring multiple countries demonstrating their comprehensive responses to COVID-19, including New Zealand, Rwanda, Thailand, the Republic of Korea, Italy and Spain. Ghebreyesus cited Mongolia as an exemplary country that has beaten Coronavirus, with zero deaths or local transmission. According to reports, all 350 confirmed cases in Mongolia were imported, with 313 people having recovered. “What Mongolia and all these stories show is that there are shared lessons that we can all learn from," said Ghebreyesus. In some countries, however, cases are going up exponentially and hospitals are reaching capacity, which poses a risk to patients and health workers alike, Ghebreyesus said. "This is leaving health workers with difficult decisions to make on how to prioritise care for those that are sick.” – SAnews.gov.za
