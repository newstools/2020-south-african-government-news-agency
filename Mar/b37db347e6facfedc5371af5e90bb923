Health Minister Zweli Mkhize says the department is seeing the recovery of people who had tested positive for COVID-19. “We are in the process of conducting further confirmation tests and medical examinations then we [will] formally inform the public on the number of recoveries. At this stage, most of the patients are recovering well,” he said. The President, as per information he received from the Health Minister, on Thursday announced that South Africa now has 150 confirmed cases of COVID-19. This means there has been an increase of 34 positive cases. The breakdown per province is as follows: Gauteng: 15 KwaZulu-Natal: 3 Mpumalanga: 1 Western Cape: 15 “As it will be noted in the above breakdown, we have stated that the contact details of some of the confirmed cases were not included in the laboratory form. This therefore puts more pressure on the NICD and provinces to track down the private doctor that the patient consulted, in order to obtain the patient’s details,” said the Health Department. The Minister pleaded with all doctors to complete the forms comprehensively so that all the patient’s information is immediately available. This, the department said, will assist in ensuring that the confirmed results are also analysed in terms of geomapping, to facilitate urgent tracing of contacts of the patient Meeting with private laboratories On Thursday afternoon, the Health Minister held an urgent teleconference with Chief Executive Officers of private laboratories that are performing the COVID-19 tests. At this meeting, the private laboratories expressed their commitment and willingness to work hand in hand with government to perform the tests for COVID-19. The meeting acknowledged that in order to allow for consistent reporting of cases, all information will be sent to the NICD in real time. There will be collaboration and proper compilation of the results, thereafter it will be released to the public. – SAnews.gov.za
