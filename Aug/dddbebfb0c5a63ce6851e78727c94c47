SASSA will reopen its system for approved applicants to change their preferred method of payment for the special COVID-19 Social Relief of Distress Grant (SRD). SASSA CEO Totsie Memela announced that the window period for preferred method of payment is scheduled for Monday, 31 August 2020 to Sunday, 06 September 2020, 24 hours a day. “During this period, beneficiaries can change from receiving their grants at the post office to receiving them through their personal bank accounts. They may also change from one bank to another if they prefer to,” Memela said on Tuesday. Approved beneficiaries of the grant can change their payment method by visiting https://srd.sassa.gov.za during this period. This development is an effort to address challenges some beneficiaries have experienced in trying to access their special relief grant from the Post Offices. She said it is important for beneficiaries to understand that they should not go to the Post Office before they have received the SMS notification that says funds are available. “The SMS notification is used to limit the numbers of people reporting to a Post Office on a particular day and also to ensure that sufficient cash is available,” Memela said. When choosing a bank account, Memela said beneficiaries should ensure the account is in their name. SASSA cannot pay money for one person into an account held by another or if the bank account is closed. “The payment process is delayed if money is sent to a closed account, as SASSA has to wait for the funds to be returned before sending it to the Post Office for collection. Clients who update their details are advised to ensure that their information is captured correctly to avoid any further delays,” Memela explained. The payment of the COVID-19 grant is quicker if paid into a bank account, and applicants without bank accounts are encouraged therefore to open accounts. “There are many entry level, inexpensive options on the market – some of which can be opened online. Clients who have just been approved for the relief grant by SASSA and have received an SMS to upload and verify their bank details can do so at any time and need not wait for the window period. “The sooner the details are uploaded, the quicker the payments can be made,” Memela said. Cash transfer The CEO announced that clients who opted to receive their special COVID-19 SRD grant through cash transfer will get their August 2020 payment through this preferred method. “They must ensure that the cell phone numbers they provided to SASSA to receive payments, are registered in their own names and not names of other people like relatives or neighbours. It is mandatory that the cell phone number should have gone through the RICA (Communication-Related Information Act) process in order for payment to be done through it. “Any citizen who does not update their information during this window period, or who provides incorrect banking details will have the payments for the remaining months sent through to the Post Office,” Memela explained.
