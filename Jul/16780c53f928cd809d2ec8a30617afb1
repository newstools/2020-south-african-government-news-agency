Due to the COVID-19 pandemic, the Presidential Imbizo will take the form of a virtual engagement, in which communities are invited to participate through community radio stations, TV channels and social media. Members of the public can submit their questions to President Ramaphosa through the following call line: +27 78 799 4480. Social media can participate using the hashtag #PresidentialImbizo.
