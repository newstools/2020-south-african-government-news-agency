Transnet Freight Rail (TFR) on Friday warned the public about fraudulent Requests for Quotations (RFQs) or proposals that are being sent under the guise of it being official TFR documents. Since the start of the COVID-19 lockdown, it has emerged that fraudulent proposals have been issued for the supply of personal protective equipment (hand sanitiser, masks and non-powdered surgical gloves) sent to unsuspecting suppliers using the TFR name, logo and employees email addresses. “The fraudulent requests are sent via email to suppliers, requesting them to send quotations or to deliver goods. "After the submission of a quote by a supplier, communication is then sent to such a supplier, that the quote has been accepted and delivery may take place or goods will be collected from the premises of the supplier,” said TRF in a statement. The company said that no Transnet employee, other than a procurement official, is allowed to manage a procurement process. “TFR would like to caution that no Transnet employee, other than a procurement official, is allowed to manage a procurement process.
