Lerule-Ramakhanya welcomed the measures announced by President Cyril Ramaphosa on Sunday to combat COVID-19. The President has declared a national state of disaster in terms of the Disaster Management Act. “As the Limpopo Legislature, we take the decision by the South African government, led by President Ramaphosa in dealing with this pandemic, very seriously… We value the health of the honourable members, the staff and the well-being of the people of Limpopo. “We would further like to call on all communities to take the Coronavirus outbreak seriously because it is our current reality and not a pandemic to be disregarded. “We will continue to strengthen our support towards government programmes for those who are infected and those who are to be tested for this virus.  We further salute the volunteers, brave men and women in our country, who continue to protect the citizens of Limpopo and the country at large,” Lerule-Ramakhanya said.
