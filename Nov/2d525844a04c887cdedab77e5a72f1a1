The World Health Organisation has recorded 45 942 902 confirmed cases, including 1 192 644 deaths, to date. Meanwhile, British Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced a new one-month national hard lockdown from Thursday as the second wave of Coronavirus infections hit England. “And in this country alas as across much of Europe the virus is spreading even faster than the reasonable worst-case scenario of our scientific advisers,” he said on Saturday, adding that if they do not act swiftly, they could see deaths in this country running at several thousand a day. According to reports, there are more than 1 million confirmed cases of Coronavirus in the United Kingdom, while 46 717 people had died. “Because of the huge exponential growth in the number of patients – by no means all of them elderly, by the way – would mean that doctors and nurses would be forced to choose which patients to treat,” Prime Minister Johnson said. – SAnews.gov.za
