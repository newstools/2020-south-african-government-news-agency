The Public Service Commission (PSC) has suspended the lodging of grievances and complaints through walk-ins at its national office and nine provincial offices. The suspension of walk-ins comes as the country aligns with President Cyril Ramaphosa’s call to the public to contain the spread of the Coronavirus pandemic. On Sunday, 15 March 2020, the President declared the Coronavirus outbreak in the country a national state of disaster. “Complainants and aggrieved public servants who wish to engage with the Public Service Commission are encouraged to use alternative means,” said the PSC.
