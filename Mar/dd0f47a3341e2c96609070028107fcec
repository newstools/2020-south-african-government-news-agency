The Health Department has confirmed eight new cases of Coronavirus (COVID-19), bringing the total number of cases to 24. “At this point, I wish to also bring it to your attention that there are more positive results that have come out. “The NICD [National Institute for Communicable Diseases] and NHLS [National Health Laboratory Service] are now verifying the information and these results. Thereafter, we will make a formal announcement,” said the Health Minister, Dr Zweli Mkhize, on Friday in a statement. Of the confirmed cases, four are from Gauteng and include two males and two females. In Gauteng, the patients include a 39-year-old female, who had travelled to Switzerland and Austria; a 50-year-old male, who had travelled to Austria; a 21-year-old female, who had travelled to Italy, and a 57-year-old male, who had travelled to Switzerland.
