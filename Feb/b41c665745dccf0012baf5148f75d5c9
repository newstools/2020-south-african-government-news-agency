Home Affairs Minister Aaron Motsoaledi says a total of 6 585 617 traveller movements across all the country’s ports of entry were recorded during the festive season. At that time, the Department of Home Affairs had deployed 404 additional staff from 03 December 2019 to 08 January 2020 to support smooth facilitation of movement of people and goods.

From 1 December 2019 to 13 January 2020, a total of 10 362 travellers were refused movement during arrival or departure.
