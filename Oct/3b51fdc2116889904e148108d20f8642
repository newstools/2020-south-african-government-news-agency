The South African government has expressed its deep sadness following the passing away of Dumisane Lubisi, who worked as the executive editor of City Press newspaper. In a statement issued on Sunday, the Government Communication and Information System (GCIS) said Lubisi was as a professional journalist, who was committed to ensuring that a plurality of voices found expression in the City Press. “Our hearts go to [his] family, friends and media colleagues,” said GCIS Director-General Phumla Williams. Government believes that media plays a critical role in serving the public interest. As South Africa and the world will be commemorating “Black Wednesday “ on 19 October to reflect on media freedom, journalists who have committed to ethics of the profession should be commended, said Williams. – SAnews.gov.za
