By Onalenna Mhlongo Eskom says there is no load shedding expected today, but the possibility remains. There is an increased probability of load shedding as Eskom has taken some generation units off the system to conduct emergency repairs. “We will utilise emergency reserves to supplement the supply overnight. “As the system is constrained, vulnerable and predictable, any additional shift in generating performance could lead to load shedding at short notice,” Eskom said. Eskom reminds South Africans that there is a possibility of increased load shedding over the next 18 months as they are conducting critical maintenance to restore the ageing plant to good health. “We request customers to use electricity sparingly and to help curb demand.” Customers should do the following to help reduce demand: “We appeal to customers to revisit their load shedding schedules on the Eskom (https://loadshedding.eskom.co.za) or local municipal websites, depending on their electricity supplier, to review amendments,” Eskom said.
