The mining sector has recorded 51 fatalities in 2019, the lowest ever recorded in the South African mining industry. “This represents a 37% improvement, year on year, compared to 2018 fatalities,” said Mineral Resources Minister Gwede Mantashe at a media briefing on the release of the 2019 mine health and safety statistics on Friday. The record comes as the mining sector marks the 60th anniversary of the Coalbrook mining disaster, which saw 435 mineworkers lose their lives on 21 January 1960. “This record is as a result of a concerted effort by all involved. The health and safety campaigns throughout the year have demonstrated that significant improvements in results can be achieved. “We, therefore, commend the collective efforts which have gotten us here,” said the Minister. Looking at the fatalities per commodity in 2019, the gold sector recorded 19 fatalities as compared to 40 in 2018, a year on year improvement of 53%.
