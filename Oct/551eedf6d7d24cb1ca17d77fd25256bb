Health Minister, Dr Zweli Mkhize, has once against warned against the risk of resurgence. “The message is there shouldn’t be complacency,” he said during a political lecture in the Eastern Cape on Wednesday. He has asked people to focus on the “new normal” of wearing masks, sanitising, social distancing, and cough etiquette especially now that international travel has been opened. “This has assisted us and therefore it is something we should continue with,” Mkhize added. He also encouraged people to download the COVID Alert SA app so people can be notified if they have been exposed to someone who has tested positive for the virus. He also thanked Cuban doctors and the WHO surge team for their support in fighting the Coronavirus in the country. “The tenets of the National Health Insurance could be recognised during COVID-19. There was the pooling of resources and a public-private partnership,” Mkhize added. “There was also infrastructure development, refurbishment, investment in health and a strong and capable workforce was built.” Mkhize said the fight against the pandemic is a non-partisan campaign, but one that involves everyone in society. “Behavioural change is the new normal. We must fight stigma and ensure vigilance,” he added. – SAnews.gov.za
