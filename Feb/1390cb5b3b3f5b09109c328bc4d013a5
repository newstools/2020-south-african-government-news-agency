In a statement last Tuesday, the Automobile Association (AA) said ongoing declines in the price of oil were likely to give South Africans a breather in February. “Ongoing declines in the price of oil, since the second week of the year, will give South African fuel users a breather for February,” said the association. It added that oil had dipped to its lowest level since the start of December 2019. “However, the Rand/US dollar exchange rate is steadily moving in the opposite direction, with the Rand having softened from its 1 January level of around R14.05 to the dollar, to its current average of R14.30.We have some concerns over this ongoing weakening in the absence of any overt Rand shocks. It is not a good sign of confidence in the SA economy,” said the AA. - SAnews.gov.za
