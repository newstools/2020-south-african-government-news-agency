While the whole globe is battling the spike of Coronavirus, nations were observing the World Hand Hygiene Day in a year that has particularly shone the spotlight on hand hygiene, the Minister said. “As we know, one of the ways Coronavirus is transferred is by hands which have come into contact with contaminated surfaces, objects or areas of the body,” he explained. He echoed the President Cyril Ramaphosa’s sentiments who believes that the COVID-19 outbreak is giving everyone an opportunity, as humanity, to review our way of life and take forward all the important lessons we are learning into a new future. “Washing hands saves lives. Remember to wash your hands thoroughly and regularly, for at least 20 seconds, with soap and water or hand sanitizer,” he added. – SAnews.gov.za
