Speaking during an interview on 702, Mkhize warned that there is going to be a lot of complacency going into the festive season. “Right now, our biggest concern is the festive season. People want to go out and enjoy themselves without adhering to containment measures.” He sent a strong message that the country is not out of the woods yet, as government works around the clock to avoid resurgence. He once again told the people that the major weapon against the deadly virus is the ability to prevent the spread and cluster outbreaks. “Therefore, washing of hands, use of sanitisers and social distancing become very important. “For now, we have no vaccine. So we need to adhere to containment measures.” According to the World Health Organisation (WHO), 54 301 156 people contracted Coronavirus since the outbreak, while 1 316 994 deaths have been recorded globally. – SAnews.gov.za
