However, not the same can be said about the death rate, which continued to surge, with over 67 000 new additional fatalities recorded. “The European and South East Asia regions continued downward trends in weekly cases; however, the European Region remains the largest contributor to new cases and new deaths in the past seven days,” the WHO added. In America, the agency noted a peak in both new cases and deaths, while the region continues to account for the greatest proportion of cumulative cases and deaths. “While cases numbers remain relatively low, the African region reported the highest increase in new cases (15%) and deaths (30%) this week,” the WHO said, adding that the highest new case and death counts were reported in South Africa, Algeria and Kenya. The Eastern Mediterranean and Western Pacific regions also reported a rise in new cases and deaths this week. In the past week, the United States reported the highest number of cases (over 1.1 million cases, 14% increase from the previous week), India (over 280 000 cases, 8% decrease), Italy (over 230 000 new cases, 3% decrease), Brazil (over 200 000 new cases, 17% increase) and France (over 170 000 new cases, 16% decrease). – SAnews.gov.za
