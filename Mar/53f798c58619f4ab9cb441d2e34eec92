While no load shedding is expected today, Eskom says the possibility that it might be implemented still remains as the power generation system is constrained and vulnerable. “We are currently utilising minimal emergency generation reserves to supplement supply. We remind the public, however, that Eskom may have to implement load shedding at short notice should the system performance deteriorate,” Eskom said. As of yesterday afternoon, unplanned breakdowns or outages were at 11 147M and planned maintenance outages are at 3 846MW. “Eskom invites all stakeholders to partner with us, through co-operation and responsible management of electricity consumption, so that we may soon emerge from these difficult times of supply constraints,” the power utility said. Customers have been requested to continue to use electricity sparingly to assist Eskom to reduce demand, by using the following tips: - Keep morning showers short to lessen the load during morning peak. - Take food out of the freezer for dinner and put it in the fridge to thaw. It’ll save having to use the microwave to defrost it later. - Set air conditioners’ average temperature at 23°C. - Switch off geysers over peak periods. - Unplug cell phone chargers before leaving the house. - Use the cold water tap rather than using the geyser every time. - Set the swimming pool pump cycle to run twice a day, three hours at a time. - At the end of the day, turn off computers, copiers, printers and fax machines at the switch. Customers can get their load shedding schedules on the Eskom website at https://loadshedding.eskom.co.za or local municipal websites, depending on their electricity supplier, to review amendments. - SAnews.gov.za
