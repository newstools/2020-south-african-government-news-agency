Twenty-nine areas have been identified for de-densification in an effort to combat the spread of Coronavirus (COVID-19). Outlining her department’s interventions to curb the spread of COVID-19 at a media briefing in Tshwane on Tuesday, Human Settlements, Water and Sanitation Minister, Lindiwe Sisulu, warned that if the virus reaches densely populated areas, it will find fertile ground to spread. “We will need to urgently move some of our people for the de-densification to be realised. Land parcels to relocate and decant dense communities have been secured. This will not be far from the current place of residence. “We appeal to our people to recognise that the threat posed by Coronavirus in our informal settlements is real. It is, therefore, in their best interest to avoid this risk by cooperating with government as we relocate them to healthier and safer homes. “Let us help each other to save the nation,” Sisulu said. The densely populated areas are mainly found in Gauteng, KwaZulu-Natal, Western Cape and Eastern Cape. Sisulu also announced that the department has received commitments from Business Unity South Africa (BUSA). BUSA has engaged with the South African National Taxi Council (SANTACO) to put in place public hand washing facilities at the top 10 taxi ranks.

In addition, over 1 000 water tanks have also been procured and are currently being delivered to affected communities. “We have put measures in place to implement our interventions. We have set up an Operation Centre at Rand Water, where we monitor the distribution of the services mentioned. “We also have provincial command centres and have mobilised the regional offices of the Water and Sanitation Department, municipalities and Regional Water Boards to act as distribution centres,” Sisulu said. - SAnews.gov.za
